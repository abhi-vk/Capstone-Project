# MERN Project

This is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) application.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (local or cloud-based, e.g., MongoDB Atlas)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-folder>
   ```

2. Install dependencies for both the frontend and backend:

   - **Frontend**:
     ```bash
     cd client
     npm install
     ```

   - **Backend**:
     ```bash
     cd ../server
     npm install
     ```

### Configuration

1. **Backend Configuration**:

   - Rename `.env.example` to `.env` in the `server` directory.
   - Add your environment variables such as:
     ```env
     PORT=5000
     MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-uri
     JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
     ```

2. **Frontend Configuration** (if applicable):
   - Adjust any API URLs in the `client` codebase to match your backend's URL.

### Running the Application

   ```

2. Start the **backend**:
